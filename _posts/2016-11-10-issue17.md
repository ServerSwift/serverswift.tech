Worth mentioning this week is [a pull request that improves documentation](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/5671)
for Swift compiler on [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux).
Also, [Swift Package Manager Version Pinning](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0145-package-manager-version-pinning.md)
proposal was returned for revision, and first meetings of Swift Server APIs Work Group happened this week
with meeting minutes publicly available on both [networking](https://github.com/swift-server/work-group/blob/master/meetings/networking/2016-11-04/minutes.md)
and [security](https://github.com/swift-server/work-group/blob/master/meetings/security/2016-11-03/minutes.md).

An interesting perspective on how Swift on servers compares to Go, Node.js, Rust, C and Java
in terms of ecosystems and overall language feel.

### [Server-Side Swift: State of the Union](https://speakerdeck.com/akosma/server-side-swift-state-of-the-union) <small>by [Adrian Kosmaczewski](https://twitter.com/akosma)</small>

Slides from [Swift Alps](http://theswiftalps.com/) talk about server-side Swift
and related libraries. If you've participated in the competition mentioned in the talk,
please let me know if you want to share what you've done, I'd love to feature that
in the next issue!

Two more videos on [Vapor](https://vapor.codes), both related to database and model side of things.

Yet another look on the current landscape of server-side frameworks
with sample code for each major library.

### [Completion Handlers as an Alternative to Delegation](http://useyourloaf.com/blog/completion-handlers-as-an-alternative-to-delegation/) <small>by [K Harrison](https://twitter.com/kharrison)</small>

>The delegation design pattern is a familiar pattern to Cocoa programmers but there are times when it seems cumbersome to create and use. In this post I look at completion handlers as an alternative to delegation. At first glance they are simpler but come with some caveats.

### [Package Samples in IBM Swift Package Catalog](https://developer.ibm.com/swift/2016/11/11/leverage-the-ibm-swift-package-catalog-to-provide-package-samples-to-your-users/) <small>by [Michael Brewer](https://www.twitter.com/mbrewed)</small>

Ever seen "Try in Sandbox" button near package description in IBM's Package
Catalog? It allows you to run Swift sample code in the cloud from your browser and
turns out you can enable that pretty easily for your own package.

### [Docker in Production: A History of Failure](https://thehftguy.wordpress.com/2016/11/01/docker-in-production-an-history-of-failure/) <small>by [The HFT Guy](https://thehftguy.wordpress.com/about/)</small> <br /> [Docker in Production: A Retort](https://patrobinson.github.io/2016/11/05/docker-in-production/) <small>and</small> <br /> [Thou Shalt Not Run a Database Inside a Container](https://patrobinson.github.io/2016/11/07/thou-shalt-not-run-a-database-inside-a-container/) <small>by [Patrick Robinson](https://twitter.com/DrNemski)</small>

These three posts are a good reminder that every new technology comes with
its own edge cases that may take years to implement properly. If you deploy
your Swift code with Docker, I highly recommend reading all three posts as
they uncover a lot of small caveats with Docker that you may stumble upon.

### [SourceKitten 0.15.0](https://github.com/jpsim/SourceKitten/releases/tag/0.15.0) <small>by [JP Simard](https://twitter.com/simjp)</small>

>SourceKitten links and communicates with `sourcekitd.framework` to parse the Swift AST, extract comment docs for Swift or Objective-C projects, get syntax data for a Swift file and lots more!
>
>This is the first release of SourceKitten to support Linux, Swift 3 and CocoaPods! ðŸŽ‰

An example of usage of SourceKitten on Linux is available in [this GitHub gist](https://gist.github.com/jpsim/3e8b45f481eff17e6f6d7afbcd74e81b).

### [json2swift: Generate Swift Data Models Based on JSON Data](https://github.com/ijoshsmith/json2swift) <small>by [Josh Smith](https://twitter.com/bach4life)</small>

> What sets this JSON-to-Swift converter apart from the others is its type inference capabilities. The net result is Swift code that uses the most appropriate data types possible. This functionality really shines when analyzing an array of elements.

It provides a protocol-oriented API and is able to generate random URLs,
Core Graphics type instances and instances of other Foundation types out of the box.

### [needless: A Utility to Find Needless Words in Swift Function Names](https://github.com/dduan/needless)

>To promote clear usage, the Swift API Design Guidelines advice that we omit needless words in function names. Words that merely repeat type information are specifically identified as needless.
>
>This is a tool that helps you spot those words in your code base.

### [Apodimark: Fast, Flexible Markdown Parser Written in Swift](https://github.com/loiclec/Apodimark)

>Apodimark is a markdown parser written in pure Swift 3. It is fast, flexible, easy to use, and works with indices instead of String, which is ideal for syntax highlighting.

### [Swish: Build Swift Projects on a Remote Machine Within Xcode.](https://github.com/thomaspaulmann/Swish)

>Swish is a simple script for remote building your Swift projects on a Linux machine. Why is that so cool? You can develop in Xcode on macOS and can use an External Build System to deploy your code on Linux.
