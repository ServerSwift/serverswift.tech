This week we've seen even more Swift 3.x activity. That was [Ubuntu 16.04 support](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4928),
[Swift 3.0.1 Preview 1 release](https://swift.org/download/#previews) and three new proposals in review:
[SE-141 for `@available` attribute for Swift version](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0141-available-by-swift-version.md),
[SE-142 for associated types constraints](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0142-associated-types-constraints.md) and
[SE-143 for generics conditional conformances](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0143-conditional-conformances.md). Here are some other
interesting tidbits: [FreeBSD compatibility PR](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4804),
[SE-141 implementation PR](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/4985),
[SwiftPM shell completion scripts](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/pull/703),
[JSONSerialization](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/648)
and [URLSession](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/662)
fixes in open-source Foundation.

### [mDevTalk: Swift Package Manager](https://honzadvorsky.com/articles/2016-09-29-19-00-mdevtalk_swift_package_manager/)

A talk by [Honza Dvorsky](https://twitter.com/czechboy0) at [mDevTalk](https://www.mdevtalk.cz)
about SwiftPM. It covers SwiftPM basics, platform and languages support, module structure,
and shows an example of a SwiftPM module that is shared between a command-line tool
and a server written in Swift.

### [Server-Side Swift Survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/V6TXDNH)

A short survey started by [Perfect](https://www.perfect.org) about server-side Swift.
As was confirmed on [Perfect Slack](http://perfect.ly), aggregated data will be
published after the poll finishes and I personally look forward to seeing it,
as the poll has some pretty interesting questions, like framework usage for
example.

A live coding session by [Robert Dickerson](https://twitter.com/rfdickerson) from IBM
featuring [Kitura](http://www.kitura.io) at [Server-Side Swift Year Long Conference](http://www.meetup.com/Server-Side-Swift-Meetup/).

### [Plugin and Runtime Library for Using Protobuf with Swift](https://github.com/apple/swift-protobuf/)

It's clear that JSON parsing libraries are so 2015 at this point and now it's
time for [Protobuf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_Buffers) parsers.
Surprisingly enough, this one comes from Apple. I only wonder, how soon will we see
[Capâ€™n Proto](https://capnproto.org) libraries?

### [General Availability: IBM Bluemix Runtime for Swift](https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/2016/09/22/bluemix-runtime-for-swift/)

Great to see that [IBM's Bluemix](https://console.ng.bluemix.net) fully supports Swift now! ðŸŽ‰

> When a developer deploys a Swift application to Bluemix Dedicated or Bluemix Local, the platform:
>
> * Provides access to a Linux container.
> * Loads the latest Swift binaries.
> * Issues a command to build your application by using the Swift Package Manager function.
> * Runs the application.

### [Swift 3.0 Unsafe World](http://technology.meronapps.com/2016/09/27/swift-3-0-unsafe-world-2/)

An article by Roberto Perez about interacting with low-level C APIs.

### [Optimizing a Copy-on-write Double-ended Queue in Swift](https://www.cocoawithlove.com/blog/2016/09/22/deque.html)

Yet another article about low-level Swift code, this one by
[Matt Gallagher](https://twitter.com/cocoawithlove). In this post he implements
a collection in Swift that supports [copy-on-write](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write) and also compares its performance
with C++ `std::deque`. The source code is also
available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mattgallagher/CwlUtils).

### [Token Authentication Now Available for Push Notifications](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=09222016a)

> You can now take advantage of a simpler method of authentication by using tokens instead of certificates when sending push notifications. A token is easy to generate, doesnâ€™t expire, and can be used to send notifications to all of your apps.

### [Swift Initializer Generator](https://github.com/Bouke/SwiftInitializerGenerator)

[Bouke Haarsma](https://twitter.com/BoukeHaarsma) published an Xcode 8 Source
Code Extension to generate Swift initializers:

> This Xcode 8 Source Code Extension will generate a Swift initializer based
on the lines you've selected. Handy if you made a struct public and now you have to provide the initializer implementation yourself.
