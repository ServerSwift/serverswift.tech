Apparently, it's that time of the year when the stream of new content related
to server-side Swift is slowing down. Because of that I'm considering a switch
to a fortnightly or monthly schedule for the newsletter.

In other news, [Package Manager Version Pinning](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0145-package-manager-version-pinning.md) Swift evolution proposal was
revised and returned for review, while a new
[Package Manager Product Definitions](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0146-package-manager-product-definitions.md) was submitted for review as well.
You will also be able to use [nested generics](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/5600/commits/5564a57668e86f325e2c005b57bad0e24ee24a66) in Swift 3.1.
Lastly, improved JSON serialization performance on Linux was [recently merged](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/pull/718).

### [Protocol Oriented Programming is Not a Silver Bullet](http://chris.eidhof.nl/post/protocol-oriented-programming/) <small>by [Chris Eidhof](https://twitter.com/chriseidhof)</small>

Interesting overview of sometimes overlooked alternatives to protocols.
It seems that after introduction of protocol extensions in Swift 2.0,
protocol-oriented programming was somewhat overhyped. The bottom line is that
you should use a tool that fits your problem.

### [Composite Validators](http://hotcocoatouch.com/2016/11/16/composite-validators/) <small>by [Scott Robbins](https://twitter.com/scottrobbinsios)</small>

If you've ever written password or email validation, you might be interested
in how to write validation in a modular and composable way.

### [Functional Programming With Swift 3](http://mislavjavor.github.io/2016/11/14/Functional-programming-with-Swift-3.html) <small>by [Mislav Javor](https://twitter.com/mislavcodes)</small>

With regards to modularity and composability, functional programming allows
you to achieve a lot with a few simple concepts. The article provides descriptions
with examples for such concepts as first-class and higher order functions,
functional purity and currying.

### [The RawRepresentable Protocol in Swift](https://oleb.net/blog/2016/11/rawrepresentable/) <small>by [Ole Begemann](http://twitter.com/olebegemann)</small>

Turns out, enums with a backing type are actually syntactic sugar that
automatically adds conformance to `RawRepresentable` protocol. Follow the link
to discover how you can add complex raw values to any type and also more details
on `OptionSet` protocol.

### [Edge â€“ A Swift Multiplatform Web and Networking Framework](https://github.com/SwiftOnEdge/Edge) <small>by [Tyler Cloutier](https://twitter.com/TylerFCloutier)</small>

> Edge is an HTTP Server and TCP Client/Server framework written in Swift and inspired by Node.js. It runs on both OS X and Linux. Like Node.js, Edge uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. In the same way that Node.js uses libuv to implement this model, Edge uses libdispatch.
