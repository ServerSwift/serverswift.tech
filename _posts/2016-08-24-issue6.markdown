### [Swift Package Manager 3.0 Project Status](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160815/026411.html)

A post by [Daniel Dunbar](https://twitter.com/daniel_dunbar):

> Since release, we have seen a rapid explosion in the package ecosystem with brand new Swift-based web frameworks (like Kitura, Perfect, Vapor, and Zewo), tooling and infrastructure (like the IBM Package Catalog and swiftenv), or simply adoption by existing popular Swift frameworks (like Alamofire, SnapKit, SwiftJSON, and RxSwift).

>We wanted to lay out our plans for the package manager with regard to the upcoming Swift 3.0 release, some project status, and a bit about our future directions...

### [Swift Snapshots on Linux Now Contain Dispatch](https://twitter.com/Chris__Bailey/status/768379960876789760)

[This is the commit](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/commit/45b80aba2f7a65aa2faed7d0818eac479478a3a7) that merges the build option to [Foundation](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation) master. In other Foundation-related news [NSURLSession was also merged](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/commit/c26f465e9af0fd4de729d746355a25c4eb52f899) recently.

### [The Perfect web framework community is now on Slack](https://twitter.com/perfectlysoft/status/767824520367529985)

In addition to [Qutheory](http://slack.qutheory.io), [Zewo](http://slack.zewo.io) and [SwiftPM](https://swift-package-manager.herokuapp.com) [Slack](https://slack.com) teams, [Perfect](https://www.perfect.org) have got one as well.

### [Doâ€™s and Donâ€™ts of AWS Lambda](https://medium.com/@tjholowaychuk/dos-and-don-ts-of-aws-lambda-7dfcab7ad115#.4b5urcqlz)

An article by [TJ Holowaychuk](https://twitter.com/tjholowaychuk) about his
experience with [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/). In my opinion,
a lot of the points from the article are easily
applicable to other serverless cloud services in general. In related news
[Paulo Faria](https://twitter.com/paulofariarl) has recently got
[Swift running on AWS Lambda](https://zewo.slack.com/archives/general/p1471373450000994)
using, unsurprisingly, [Apex](https://github.com/apex/apex) by TJ Holowaychuk.

### [Swift for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rlovelett.vscode-swift-language)

This plugin for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) by
[Ryan Lovelett](https://twitter.com/rlovelett) supports
completion lists, symbol resolution and potentially much more in the future.
[SourceKitten](https://github.com/jpsim/SourceKitten) is a dependency, so no
native Linux support for now, but you can track a corresponding
[SourceKitten PR](https://github.com/jpsim/SourceKitten/pull/223).

### [Dependencies of Your SwiftPM Packages as a Service](https://github.com/czechboy0/swiftpm-dependency-fetcher)

[Honza Dvorsky](https://twitter.com/czechboy0) has published a service that
can build a dependencies graph of any SwiftPM package. There is a variety of
possible output formats and renderings, and it provides a simple
[web interface](http://swiftpm-deps.honza.tech/web).

### [How AI and Machine Learning Work at Apple](https://backchannel.com/an-exclusive-look-at-how-ai-and-machine-learning-work-at-apple-8dbfb131932b#.8n964ngfw)

An in-depth article about Apple's AI/ML cloud & services initiatives. Some
of those services have substantial machine learning-related computations running
on client devices, but obviously server-side is more interesting to us. ðŸ˜‰

### [Aphid](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Aphid)

A lightweight [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/) 3.1.1 client written in pure Swift 3 from
[IBM Swift](https://github.com/IBM-Swift) team.

### [LangKit](https://github.com/rxwei/LangKit)

Natural Language Processing toolkit for Swift. Unfortunately, this is marked
as "will not be updated". There are plenty of useful algorithms
implemented in the repository, so I hope that someone in Swift community will pick
up ownership of the code.

### [ZWeatherServer](https://github.com/CaryZheng/ZWeatherServer)

> A weather server based on Vapor

### [Slimane](https://github.com/noppoMan/slimane)
