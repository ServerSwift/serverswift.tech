Yet another week, yet another Swift 3.0.1 preview, this time it's
[Preview 3](https://swift.org/download/#releases).
[Swift Evolution status page](http://apple.github.io/swift-evolution/) was also
refined with more versions added to corresponding proposals. As for
Linux-specific stuff, there is a
[compiler PR](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/5269) to support static
linking from [Simon Evans](https://github.com/spevans) with a corresponding
[Swift Jira issue](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2280). Please vote it up
if you would like to see working Swift executables that can be freely copied to any Linux box.
